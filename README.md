# RockhoundersResort Project
This is a fully functional web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Nodejs and Express, 
with EJS for templating, and MongoDB for backend. This project was started during one of my classes
in college and I continue to work on it to hone my software development and secure programming skills.
